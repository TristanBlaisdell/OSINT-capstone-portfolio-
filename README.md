# 🛰️ OSINT Capstone ePortfolio  
### Tristan Blaisdell | SNHU CS-499 | Bachelor of Science in Computer Science  

This repository contains my **Computer Science Capstone ePortfolio** for Southern New Hampshire University.  
It showcases the **Open Source Intel (OSINT)** mobile application I developed and enhanced across three key areas of computer science:

- **Software Design & Engineering:** Secure architecture and modular Flutter UI  
- **Algorithms & Data Structures:** Recursive threaded forum and efficient data retrieval  
- **Databases:** Firebase Cloud Firestore integration with role-based access control

## 📘 Overview
The **OSINT App** is a Flutter-based mobile platform designed to aggregate and analyze real-time open-source intelligence.  
Key features include:
- End-to-end encrypted private messaging  
- Nested threaded public forum with upvote/downvote system  
- Bias-labeled news feed sorted by region and source  
- Interactive live incident globe powered by LiveUAMap and Telegram feeds  

These enhancements demonstrate expertise in **full-stack mobile development**, **secure coding**, **algorithmic problem-solving**, and **cloud database design**.
