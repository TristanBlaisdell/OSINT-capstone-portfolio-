# Enhancement 2 ‚Äî Algorithms & Data Structures

**Artifact:** News Clustering & Ranking Pipeline  
**Focus:** Shingling ‚Üí MinHash ‚Üí LSH ‚Üí Union-Find ‚Üí Composite Scoring  
**Key Files:**  
- `lib/news_screen.dart` (controller + UI)  
- `lib/data/news_connectors.dart` (RSS/Guardian/NYT connectors)  
- `lib/data/news_models.dart` (Article model)

## üéØ Overview and Purpose

The goal of this enhancement was to transform the app‚Äôs naive chronological news feed into an **intelligent, deduplicated, and ranked feed** using applied algorithms and data structures. The enhancement demonstrates the ability to design and evaluate efficient computing solutions that manage trade-offs between accuracy, speed, and scalability.

Specifically, this enhancement added:
- **Clustering** of near-duplicate articles using Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) on MinHash signatures of k-shingles.  
- **Ranking** based on a composite score (recency, credibility, engagement, novelty).  
- **Entity filtering** using an inverted index structure for topic-based exploration.  

These algorithmic improvements enable meaningful organization of open-source news data while preserving performance and accuracy.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Pre-Enhancement Context

Before enhancement, the feed simply displayed all news items sorted by publish date.  
There was **no deduplication**, **no similarity detection**, and **no ranking beyond recency**.  
To document this stage, see the reconstructed notes in [Original State](original_state.md).

## üß© Algorithmic Pipeline

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Text Normalization & Shingling
Input text is cleaned (lowercased, punctuation removed, stop words filtered) and split into **5-word shingles**.  
Each shingle is hashed using **FNV-1a (32-bit)** for compact set representation.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ MinHash Signature Generation
Each article‚Äôs shingle set is transformed into a **64-element MinHash signature** using an affine hash family.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH)
The 64-element signature is divided into **8 bands** of **8 rows each**.  
Items that share identical band hashes are treated as potential duplicates.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Similarity Validation & Clustering
Candidate pairs are compared by estimated and true Jaccard similarity.  
If both thresholds pass (est ‚â• 0.75, true ‚â• 0.80), articles are merged using a **Union-Find** structure.

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Representative Selection
Each cluster chooses one ‚Äúcanonical‚Äù article based on source reliability weight and recency decay factor.

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Composite Cluster Score
Clusters are ranked by a composite score that combines:  
Recency, Wilson credibility, Source reliability, Engagement, and Novelty.

### 7Ô∏è‚É£ Entity Filtering
An inverted index maps entities (like ‚ÄúNATO‚Äù, ‚ÄúUkraine‚Äù, ‚ÄúElections‚Äù) to the article IDs where they appear.  
Users can filter by one or more entities to view only clusters that match all selected topics.

## üß† Data Structures Used

| Structure | Purpose |
|------------|----------|
| `Set<int>` | Stores hashed k-shingles for text similarity |
| `List<int>` | MinHash signature (length 64) for Jaccard estimation |
| `Map<String, Set<String>>` | Entity-to-article inverted index |
| `UnionFind` | Efficient clustering of similar articles |
| `LSH` | Locality Sensitive Hashing for approximate nearest-neighbor lookup |

---

## ‚è±Ô∏è Complexity & Performance

| Stage | Structure | Typical Cost |
|---|---|---|
| Shingling | Set of hashes | O(T) per article, T = tokens |
| MinHash | 64 affine hashes | O(64 √ó |shingles|) |
| LSH add/query | bands=8, rows=8 | O(8) per add/query |
| Pair confirm | Jaccard | O(|A| + |B|) per collision |
| Clustering | Union-Find | near O(Œ±(N)) |
| Ranking | Composite arithmetic | O(#clusters) |

Trade-offs: Increasing `m` or tightening thresholds raises precision but increases runtime.  
Banding (8√ó8) balances recall vs. precision for short-form news text.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Parameters and Thresholds

| Parameter | Value | Description |
|------------|--------|-------------|
| `k` | 5 | Shingle size |
| `m` | 64 | MinHash signature length |
| `bands` | 8 | LSH bands |
| `rowsPerBand` | 8 | LSH rows per band |
| `est-Jaccard` | ‚â• 0.75 | MinHash similarity threshold |
| `true-Jaccard` | ‚â• 0.80 | Confirmed similarity threshold |

### Composite Weighting

| Factor | Weight |
|--------|--------|
| Recency | 0.40 |
| Credibility | 0.20 |
| Source Reliability | 0.20 |
| Engagement | 0.15 |
| Novelty | 0.05 |

### Source Reliability Priors

| Source | Reliability |
|---------|-------------|
| AP | 0.92 |
| Reuters | 0.93 |
| BBC | 0.90 |
| NYTimes | 0.87 |
| CNN | 0.80 |
| Fox | 0.78 |
| Unknown | 0.60 |

## üß™ Edge Cases & Safeguards

- Empty or short articles default to a single shingle (still clusterable).  
- Invalid or missing timestamps default to current time for safe scoring.  
- Entity filters automatically refresh when toggled.  
- Feed gracefully handles failed connectors (skips instead of crashes).

## üéì Course Outcomes Alignment

| Outcome | Application |
|----------|--------------|
| **Algorithmic Design** | Implemented multi-stage clustering using MinHash + LSH + Union-Find |
| **Data Structures** | Efficient sets, maps, and disjoint sets to manage relationships |
| **Performance Evaluation** | Tuned parameters for optimal balance of recall and speed |
| **Security Mindset** | Weighted sources by credibility; neutral defaults prevent bias |
| **Communication** | Clear code modularization, consistent comments, structured scoring |
