# 🛰️ Professional Self-Assessment  
### Tristan Blaisdell | SNHU CS-499 Capstone | Bachelor of Science in Computer Science  

Welcome to my Computer Science Capstone ePortfolio.  
This portfolio demonstrates the culmination of my academic journey at Southern New Hampshire University and showcases the skills, knowledge, and professional mindset I have developed throughout the Computer Science program.  

---

## 🎯 Overview

The featured project in this ePortfolio is my **Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) Mobile Application**, a secure, Flutter-based platform built with Firebase that aggregates, analyzes, and visualizes global open-source intelligence. Through this project, I integrated key concepts from software engineering, data structures and algorithms, and database management to deliver a functional and secure solution aligned with real-world industry needs.

This ePortfolio highlights my enhancements in the following three core areas:
- **Software Design & Engineering**
- **Algorithms & Data Structures**
- **Databases**

Each enhancement section demonstrates measurable growth, problem-solving ability, and mastery of professional software development practices.

## 👥 Collaboration and Communication

Throughout my coursework and capstone project, I learned the importance of collaboration and clear communication. Whether working in Agile team simulations, writing technical documentation, or recording code reviews, I developed the ability to explain complex concepts to both technical and non-technical audiences.  
In professional settings, this translates to collaborating effectively across diverse teams to support decision-making and project alignment.

## ⚙️ Software Engineering and Design

My capstone artifact, the OSINT app, reflects real-world engineering practices. I applied modular design principles, implemented secure authentication using Firebase, and improved the UI/UX through reusable Flutter components. These enhancements demonstrate my ability to design scalable, maintainable, and user-centric software systems.

---

## 🧮 Data Structures and Algorithms

Efficiency and scalability were central to my algorithmic enhancements. I implemented recursive threading for nested forum discussions, optimized Firebase queries for data retrieval, and added sorting logic to rank posts by “Top,” “New,” or “Old.” These changes demonstrate proficiency in applying algorithmic principles to improve system performance.

---

## 🗄️ Databases and Data Management

Database integrity and security were key focuses. I designed and implemented a secure NoSQL Firestore schema with role-based access, validation, and privacy controls. This demonstrated my ability to work with cloud-based databases while applying security best practices to protect user data.

---

## 🔒 Security Mindset

From my coursework in **CS-405 Secure Coding** and **CS-320 Software Testing**, I developed a proactive security mindset. I applied this mindset to the OSINT app by ensuring encrypted communication, authentication, and data validation. My work reflects a deep understanding of how to anticipate and mitigate potential vulnerabilities in real-world applications.

---

## 🚀 Professional Growth and Goals

Completing this degree and capstone project has shaped my professional goals and solidified my desire to work in the field of **intelligence and cybersecurity**. I plan to pursue a career within the intelligence community, leveraging my technical expertise, problem-solving ability, and dedication to national security.

This program has not only advanced my technical skills but also my adaptability, persistence, and ability to integrate complex systems — qualities essential for success in the evolving field of computer science.
